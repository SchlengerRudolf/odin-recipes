        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <h5>Dough</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Large Egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>    
            <li>3/4 cup water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Filling</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>18 ounces ground beef</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ice-cold water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup; add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup.</li>
            <li>Pour into a large bowl and knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic</li>
            <li>Cover with a dish towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork. Set aside</li>
            <li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside</li>
            <li>Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out</li>
            <li>Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter</li>
            <li>Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle</li>
            <li>Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent</li>
            <li>Join the ends and pinch them together</li>
            <li>Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Working in batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Continue cooking for 5 more minutes</li>
            <li>Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon. Serve and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
